# Binary Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This repository contains an implementation of a binary image classification model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in PyTorch. The model is trained and evaluated on the <strong>CIFAR-10 dataset</strong>, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The task is to classify each image as either a cat or a dog.


The model achieved an accuracy of 98.3% on the test set after training for 50 epochs. The training and validation curves are shown below:
